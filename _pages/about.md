My name is Dominik Kotarski.
I'm a software engineer from Zagreb, Croatia, currently employed at ZG Informatika.

I have iterated through a few about pages. None of them were good.
This is a placeholder until I come up with something.

In the meantime, I encourage you to take a look at my [personal projects](/projects)
