My name is Dominik Kotarski.
I'm a software engineer from Zagreb, Croatia, currently employed at ZG Informatika.

My professional interests include all things software, with concrete topics ranging from graphical game engines to distributed systems. Some of my free time is spent on maintaining this blog and pursuing personal projects. I encourage you to take a look at some of [them](/projects) to get a better picture of my past ventures.
