My name is Dominik Kotarski.
I'm a software engineer from Zagreb, Croatia, currently employed at ZG Informatika.

My professional interests include all things software. Some of my free time is spent on maintaining this blog and pursuing personal projects. I encourage you to take a look at some of [them](/projects)
