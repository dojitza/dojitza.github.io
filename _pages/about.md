My name is Dominik Kotarski.
I'm a software engineer from Zagreb, Croatia, currently employed at ZG Informatika.

I am passionate about accessible education, since it is my firm belief that most of humanity lacks proper access to it. My dream is to bring the best possible learning experience to every single child and adult in the world. 

I encourage you to take a look at my [personal projects](/projects)
