Title: UIP 1 - Introduction
---

Hello and welcome to the introduction of my new project.
It will be a 2.5d platformer game the idea of which me and my friend came up with when we were 9 years old.

I am building this game to improve upon my knowledge of c++ and surrounding tools.
I intend the game to be multi-platform and to support several low level graphic libraries for rendering.
Because I am not very familiar with the graphic libraries, I am going to start with [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) â€“ a simple 2d library built around openGL.
I will try to abstract the rendering library away and will address this in one of the following posts.
