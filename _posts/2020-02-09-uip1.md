Title: UIP 1 - Introduction
---

Hello and welcome to the introduction of my new project.
It will be a 2.5d platformer game that my friend came up with when we were 9 years old and which we
played in our imagination during the school breaks.

I am building this game to improve my knowledge of c++ and surrounding tools.
I intend the game to be multi-platform and to support several low level graphic libraries for rendering.
Because I am not very familiar with the graphic libraries, I am going to start with a simple 2d one - 
[SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/).
I will try to abstract the rendering library away from the start and I will address this in one of the following post.
