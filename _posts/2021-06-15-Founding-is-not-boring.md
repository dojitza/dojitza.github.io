Being young in the tech industry is sometimes tantalizing. The abundance of choice the seller's market provides can sometimes paralize a person. A dream of founding one's own venture creeps into the mind.

I've been thinking about the prospect for some time now and would like to share some of my thoughts.

Founding a company is akin to gambling. An average person is worse off pouring their resources founding one than just investing into the market. Then again, an average person does not exist - perhaps you are one of the lucky few that are capable of founding a successful startup. What I believe is sometimes overlooked, but have concluded that many veterans to the startup scene know is how big of a factor luck is. So, what should you do as an aspiring young person?

I oversimplify and formulate two paths:

A: Work for a wage. Invest in the global economy. Spend time raising children. Pursue low-yield, enjoyment focused hobbies and personal connection. Give to others by volunteering and being active in the community. Leave a mark in the world.

B: Grind yourself for the benefit of humankind by founding a company.With any luck, it provides value for a large number of people, you live better off than in scenario A, and contribute more to the community with your generous resource allocation, job provision etc. Validate your ambition and leave a mark in the world.

To some, option A sounds like a superior choice. However, in my opinion it is unsuitable for many. There are individuals that are incapable of living the boring life. These people usually spend their time betting on sports, day trading stocks/cryptocurrency or gambling. Founding a company at least involves a lot of agency.

So, if you like risks with high yields that you have agency over, have the knowledge, are ambitious and resilient - try founding a company. Otherwise, there are plenty of boring alternatives with higher expected value.
