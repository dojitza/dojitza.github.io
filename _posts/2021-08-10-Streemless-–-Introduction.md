Do you often wander around your house with earbuds, bobbing your head to the rhythm?
Well, I do. Sometimes, though, I can't have those on, and the music still wants to be played. Of course, the solution exists, and it is called multiroom audio. Apparently, it is reserved for well off audiophiles only, because all the solutions that I found were a tad too expensive. 

So I started looking. Was there an accessible, easy to use solution available? Well, [sort of](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast), but you need your own hardware, and it ain't exactly easy to setup. Having done some more research, I decided to build my own multiroom audio system. This one will be browser based, which means portable, and as easy to setup as it's easy to boot up a browser on a device that has an aux-out port.

My original idea was to keep everything in the browser, but since I can not (even though I'd love to) integrate my client with major audio/music providers it became apparent that I'd need some kind of player to power the browser clients doing the playback. I have a couple ideas for this but more on that later. 

The first step will be to connect the clients and synchronise audio playback of a preloaded sound file. A good chunk of the work has been done, and expect a post with more details and an update soon(ish).

Thank you for reading, and happy listening.
