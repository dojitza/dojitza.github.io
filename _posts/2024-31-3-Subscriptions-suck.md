Title: Subscriptions suck

Dark patterns in subscriptions are a huge problem. They cost businesses (yes you read that right) billions every year. 

To unsubscribe from a service, you often have to do one or multiple of:

- A phone call which ends up with a sales rep convincing you to stay
- Physical visit to a brick and mortar location.
- Click through a long and painful multi-step flow.

As a result, one is not wrong to deeply distrust any and all subscriptions. It is safe to say we have all been burned by an unfair subscription at least once.

### What I do as a consumer

As a consumer, I can’t do much other than spend extra time researching whether a subscription is fair, or the company is shady. 

In practice, I don't do that. I avoid all subscriptions unless absolutely necessary. I can confidently say that companies are missing out on a lot of my \$\$\$ every month, just because in my mind the concept of subscription is tainted.

### What you can do as a business

A) Don’t offer subscriptions. (let’s skip this one for now, a topic for its own post)

- OR -

B) Heavily invest into positive differentiation of your subscription contracts. 

Subscriptions should be care-free, meaning the whole process, from signup flow, to cancellation leaves the consumer feeling how doing business with your company is such a refreshing experience.

Here are some things you could say. Please ask your copywriter to come up with something better though.

- “We don’t want to see you go, but if you want to, it will take 1 click”
- “Unsubscribing with us is easier then subscribing”
- Absolutely no cancellation fees: You pay for what you **used** and not a cent more.
- Unsubscribing take one click, but your data is safe for 30 days in case you change your mind unless you explicitly tell us to delete it.
